# gomod-issues

I've been having issues with goland and go.mod integration

When I start this repo goland informs me that it's detected modules and it has enabled them for me.

I then enter the go.mod file in goland; right click the first module (line 6) and click "Sync go module" - This causes my activity bar at the bottom to breifly flash. But modules did not get downloaded
